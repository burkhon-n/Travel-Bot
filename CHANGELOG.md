- ✅ Participant limit configuration
- ✅ Trip status tracking (active/completed/cancelled)
- ✅ Group invite link management (participant & guest links)

#### Payment Tracking
- ✅ Payment status enum (not_paid/half_paid/full_paid)
- ✅ Receipt upload functionality (photo/PDF)
- ✅ **Changed flow**: Auto mark as `half_paid` on receipt upload
- ✅ Admin approval/rejection workflow
- ✅ Seat reservation for both half_paid and full_paid members

- ✅ Member management per trip

#### Member Management
- ✅ Display user full name and Telegram ID

- ✅ Updated button labels to reflect new flow

#### Race Condition Protection
- ✅ Commit-then-verify pattern in receipt handler
- ✅ Automatic rollback on capacity overflow

### Phase 6: Code Quality & Performance ✅

#### Database Optimization

  - (trip_id, payment_status)
  - (user_id, payment_status)
  - (user_id, joined_at)
- ✅ Unique constraint on (user_id, trip_id)
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with cascade rules

#### Error Handling

#### Configuration Management
- ✅ Added `Config.validate()` method
